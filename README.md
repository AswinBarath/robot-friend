## What's unique in this Project

- The robot-friend EVE is created using basic HTML5, CSS3 and animations.
- The shapes of the robot are coded using border-radius property from CSS3.
- The positioning of the body parts like head, inner-head, eyes, arms and torso are made possible with the help of <em>Flexbox</em>
- So, hover over our robot-friend EVE to experience the animation effect.
